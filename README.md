# Predicting-secondary-student-performance

This was a group project for ML1998 (Machine Learning in Practice)

Group Members: Lakshmi Kanikkannan, Curtis Herges, Jeffrey Oliver

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Given a dataset of demographic, lifestyle, social and school related attributes of students, predict student
performance. Data is available at https://www.mldata.io/dataset-details/school_grades/

Three scenarios of predictions will be considered,
i) Classification with two levels (pass/fail);
ii) Classification with five levels (from I - excellent to V - insufficient); and
iii) Regression, with a numeric output that ranges between 0 and 20.
Outcome variable is G3 (final grade; numeric from 0 to 20).
Your work should include comparison between different machine-learning models (one of which must be
linear, and at least 2 non-linear models).
Try to exclude G1 and/or G2 variables from your models.
